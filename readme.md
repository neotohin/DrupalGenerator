# DrupalGenerator

Will replicate the functionality of Netbeans Drupal Plugin. To achieve an easier way to generate skeleton for new modules, theme and panels layout.

**This is a work in progress project**

## How It will Work
Will provide contextual links in sidebar.
  'New Module'
  'New Theme'
  'New Panles Layout'

## How its different from Snippet
Snippet can generate a single file where this plugin will generate multiple files on the fly. Eample: Will prompt for module name from user; then will generate necessary .info , .install and .module files.
